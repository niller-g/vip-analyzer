//! This module handles fuzzy-searching of functions, structs and other symbols
//! by name across the whole workspace and dependencies.
//!
//! It works by building an incrementally-updated text-search index of all
//! symbols. The backbone of the index is the **awesome** `fst` crate by
//! @BurntSushi.
//!
//! In a nutshell, you give a set of strings to `fst`, and it builds a
//! finite state machine describing this set of strings. The strings which
//! could fuzzy-match a pattern can also be described by a finite state machine.
//! What is freaking cool is that you can now traverse both state machines in
//! lock-step to enumerate the strings which are both in the input set and
//! fuzz-match the query. Or, more formally, given two languages described by
//! FSTs, one can build a product FST which describes the intersection of the
//! languages.
//!
//! `fst` does not support cheap updating of the index, but it supports unioning
//! of state machines. So, to account for changing source code, we build an FST
//! for each library (which is assumed to never change) and an FST for each Rust
//! file in the current workspace, and run a query against the union of all
//! those FSTs.
